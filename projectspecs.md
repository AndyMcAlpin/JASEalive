Your project should fulfill the following requirements:
-Use React for the front end.
-Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
-Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
-Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
-Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
-Have a polished UI.
-Be responsive.
-Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
-Include authentication (JWT).
-Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
-Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation,  high-quality comments, etc.).
-Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).


installations:
npm install jsonwebtoken
npm install --save-dev nodemon
npm i @apollo/client graphql
npm install react-router-dom


Apollo Client (@apollo/client) is an all-in-one dependency that enables us to connect to a GraphQL API server and execute queries or mutations using their own special form of React Hooks.
GraphQL (graphql) is a dependency much like MySQL2 was for Sequelize. We don't use it directly, but it needs to be present so that the GraphQL syntax used with Apollo Client can be understood.
